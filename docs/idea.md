Product Name: PocketPaw

Tagline: The Sovereign Interface for your "Dusty Laptop."
Version: 1.0 (The "Strike" Edition)

1. Executive Summary

PocketPaw is the mobile command center for the "Sovereign AI" revolution. It turns any idle computer (Mac Mini, old Lenovo, dusty laptop) into a powerful, autonomous employee that you control via Telegram.

While others are "sitting on the sidelines," PocketPaw users are deploying agents that work, code, and market themselves while their owners sleep. It is zero-config, runs on local hardware, and includes a "Hype Engine" that autonomously generates viral content to spread the movement.

2. User Stories (The "Hype" Cycle)

The "Underground Builder"

"I have a Python script running my crypto trading bot on an old laptop. I want to text it 'Status?' and get a P&L report instantly, without SSH or complex dashboards."

The "Viral Launcher" (New)

"I just automated my entire data entry job. I want PocketPaw to screen-record itself doing the work, add a cool AI voiceover saying 'While you work 9-5, I work 24/7', and save it as a TikTok-ready video so I can flex on X (Twitter)."

The "Sovereign Individual"

"I don't trust the cloud. I want my files, my vision models, and my agent to run locally. PocketPaw lets me control my sovereign infrastructure from a secure, encrypted chat."
